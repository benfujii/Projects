- Utilized Microsoft Excel to clean the dataset that contained over 14,000 rows
- Used pivot tables to perform a general breakdown of the data, where I found the general customer satisfaction per airline and causes of negative reviews
- Implemented dummy variables to perform a key-word search within the tweets in order to find the sentiment behind specific words
- Ran linear regression models against these key-word searches in order to understand the impact they were having on customer satisfaction
- Ran additional linear regression models to find the airlines' overall impact on a customer's review being positive
