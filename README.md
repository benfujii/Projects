# [Project 1: Twitter Airline Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/benfujii/Projects/blob/main/Twitter%20Airline%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20-%20Excel.pptx)
## Microsoft Excel

- Utilized Microsoft Excel to clean the dataset that contained over 14,000 rows
- Used pivot tables to perform a general breakdown of the data, where I found the general customer satisfaction per airline and causes of negative reviews
- Implemented dummy variables to perform a key-word search within the tweets in order to find the sentiment behind specific words
- Ran linear regression models against these key-word searches in order to understand the impact they were having on customer satisfaction
- Ran additional linear regression models to find the airlines' overall impact on a customer's review being positive

# [Project 2: New York City AirBNB Analysis](https://github.com/benfujii/Projects/blob/main/NYC_AirBNB%20(1).ipynb)
## Python
**April 2021 - May 2021**

- Analyzed a 45,000+ row dataset with Python in order to discover how characteristics such as price, average rating, location, and the room type optimize an AirBNB listing's price and demand
- Worked alongside two classmates to answer nine analysis questions regarding the dataset
- In order to analyze the data and answer the questions, I standardized (z-scored) variables, utilized clustering algorithms including DBSCAN, created linear and logistic regression models, and also utilized Lasso regression models
- Created multiple data visualizations per questions that clearly and effectively depicted findings
- Described analysis process on both the jupyter notebook file and in a video presentation, which is linked below

# [Project 3: Retail Startup Location Analysis](https://github.com/benfujii/Projects/blob/main/Retail%20Startup%20Location%20Analysis%20Excel%20File.xlsx) 
## Microsoft Excel
**November 2021**

- Cleaned and analyzed 8 different datasets that totaled over 500,000 rows of data regarding general information on cities around the US
- Utilized pivot tables and min and max functions to establish a specific target market
- Created linear regression models to indicate what makes a location "good" for a retail startup
- Implemented filtering, pivot tables, and linear regression in order to determine the top 10 most optimal locations for launching a retail startup based on the previous regression model's results
- Created clear and effective data visualizations for each city to visualize the potential of each respecrive city
- Powerpoint that summarizes findings and results as well as the processes taken linked below
