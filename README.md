Data Analytics Projects by Ben Fujii

# [Project 1: Twitter Airline Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/benfujii/Projects/blob/main/Twitter%20Airline%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20-%20Excel.pptx)
## Microsoft Excel
**September 2021 - October 2021**

- Utilized Microsoft Excel to clean the dataset that contained over 14,000 rows
- Used pivot tables to perform a general breakdown of the data, where I found the general customer satisfaction per airline and causes of negative reviews
- Implemented dummy variables to perform a key-word search within the tweets in order to find the sentiment behind specific words
- Ran linear regression models against these key-word searches in order to understand the impact they were having on customer satisfaction
- Ran additional linear regression models to find the airlines' overall impact on a customer's review being positive

# [Project 2: New York City AirBNB Analysis](https://github.com/benfujii/Projects/blob/main/NYC_AirBNB%20(1).ipynb)
## Python
**April 2021 - May 2021**

- Analyzed a 45,000+ row dataset with Python in order to discover how characteristics such as price, average rating, location, and the room type optimize an AirBNB listing's price and demand
- Worked alongside two classmates to answer nine analysis questions regarding the dataset
- In order to analyze the data and answer the questions, I standardized (z-scored) variables, utilized clustering algorithms including DBSCAN, created linear and logistic regression models, and also utilized Lasso regression models
- Created multiple data visualizations per questions that clearly and effectively depicted findings
- Described analysis process on both the jupyter notebook file and in a video presentation, which is linked below

# [Project 3: Retail Startup Location Analysis](https://github.com/benfujii/Projects/blob/main/Retail%20Startup%20Location%20Analysis%20Excel%20File.xlsx) 
## Microsoft Excel
**November 2021**

- Cleaned and analyzed 8 different datasets that totaled over 500,000 rows of data regarding general information on cities around the US
- Utilized pivot tables and min and max functions to establish a specific target market
- Created linear regression models to indicate what makes a location "good" for a retail startup
- Implemented filtering, pivot tables, and linear regression in order to determine the top 10 most optimal locations for launching a retail startup based on the previous regression model's results
- Created clear and effective data visualizations for each city to visualize the potential of each respecrive city
- Powerpoint that summarizes findings and results as well as the processes taken linked below

# [Project 4: Rosetta Stone Subscriber Analysis](https://github.com/benfujii/Projects/blob/main/Rosetta%20Stone%20Subscriber%20Optimization.pptx)
## Python
**November 2021 - December 2021**

- Collaborated with other classmates in order to clean and analyze a 40,000+ row dataset regarding data of Rosetta Stone's subscriber base
- Created a weighted scoring method in order to uncover the most important subscribers in terms of spending and engagement by using z-scoring, as well as various linear regression models
- Utilized the K-Means clustering algorithm in order to display four distinct subscriber segments within the subscriber base depending on spending, engagement, and location
- Wrote an analysis of findings and our processes in an action plan, which is linked below, as well as presented Powerpoint that summarized these findings to the class

# [Project 5: Zomato Aggregate Rating Analysis](https://github.com/benfujii/Projects/blob/main/Zomato's%20Aggregate%20Rating%20Breakdown.pptx)
## R
**November 2020 - December 2020**

<img width="342" alt="Picture2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87784856/167702686-24d61be0-5406-4944-a1a5-7a9d6e9a50b2.png">

- Worked alongside four other classmates in order to analyze and clean a 10,000+ row dataset that contained data about Zomato's restaurants
- Created an Elastic Net Regression model, starting with creating a min loss plot to find the optimal alpha and lambda, in order to find which variables are most closely correlated with the average rating of a restaruant
- Presented findings to class using a breakdown powerpoint, which is linked above
